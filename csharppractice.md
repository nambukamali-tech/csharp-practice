# C# Daily Practice

This repository contains my **daily C# practice codes**.  
I upload programs regularly - just random exercises, experiments, and small snippets while learning.

## Notes
- Code is for practice only.  
- Not organized by topic — just daily uploads.  
- Goal: stay consistent and keep improving in C#.
